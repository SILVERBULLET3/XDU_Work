This folder contains the main research results of my undergraduate studies at Xidian University, including fault-tolerant routing algorithms, random signal analysis, massive MIMO, etc. The fault-tolerant routing algorithm includes a description of the new routing algorithm, source code, explanatory papers and a review. The main content of the stochastic signal analysis section is a research report, and the main contribution is to analyze the N-dimensional probability distribution of the narrow-band Gaussian process superimposed by a sinusoidal signal using a eigenfunction. The massive MIMO part is a review paper.
